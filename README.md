# fraud_detection: learning journey
Fraud Detection in Banking [pipelining, EDA&amp;preprocessing, splitting, &amp; prediction]

Codes adapted from @amalinadhi and @davidsirait have been revised and elaborated for analytical and learning purposes. This repo is part of the learning path in Pacmann.io, 2024. 
I highly recommend Pacmann, as it offers slow-paced learning with relevant hands-on experience. Thanks to David Sirait, the lecturer. His explanation was clear and really informative. 

Personally, this skillset as a Data Scientist in contextualization, experimentation, and data storytelling is quintessential. This learning helped me gain a clearer view of what is really happening in anomaly and credit card detection in the banking industry.

As interesting as it sounds, I noted several learning experiences that would help me to hone my career as an internal auditor/IT auditor:

1. The learning curve in some areas might be steep. Thus, we need a strategy.
2. The learning journey outline;
a. building an IDE that will streamline the process [VSCode, Github, Kaggle environment, Conda + local Jupyter Notebook]
b. saving data in the pickle version and calling it as we need it.
c. file numbers 1-5 are .ipynb - it gives a better view of the analytical sequences.
d. Later on, the .ipynb could be converted into a .py file so we would have an executing file 

In short, the raw data we get (from a Backend Engineer or Data Engineer) needs some cleansing and preprocessing before we can build a robust model. 
That's when our role as a Data Scientist comes into play; to build 


The main objective is to build an ML that predicts future transactions, whether they are legitimate transactions or fraudulent ones.
